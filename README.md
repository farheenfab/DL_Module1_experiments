# Deep Learning Module 1

I have experimented with basic torch and torchvision operations in the 3 notebooks of this repository. 
1. distributions.ipynb: experimented with Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions using tensors
2. model.ipynb: experimented with torchvision by using images as tensors and implemented nearest neighbours and K-nearest neighbours Classifiers, and K-nearest neighbours Regression
3. tensors.ipynb: experimented with basic tensor operations and basic linear algebra with tensors.
